# Libft

Libft is a custom implementation of essential functions from the C standard library, built from scratch as part of the 42 Network's foundational projects. This project focuses on mastering memory management, string operations, and pointer manipulation in C.

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Understand and reimplement standard C library functions
- Improve knowledge of memory handling, strings, and pointers
- Follow strict coding norms and write clean, readable C code

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is split into two parts:

### Part 1 - Libc Functions
Reimplementation of commonly used functions from `<ctype.h>`, `<string.h>`, and `<stdlib.h>`, such as:

- `ft_isalpha`
- `ft_strlen`
- `ft_strcpy`
- `ft_memset`
- `ft_strdup`
- And many more...

### Part 2 - Additional Functions
More utility functions such as:

- `ft_split`
- `ft_itoa`
- `ft_strmapi`
- `ft_substr`

## 🔧 Installation & Usage
